For the first time my AoC ended on the 25th and whilst I wish this was because
of a year of improvements on my end I think it is more to do with the level
of difficulty sliding a long way down the North Pole this year.

With individual posts for each day already up on the site, this isn't going to
be a long post but there are a few overall things worth mentioning.

## Requiem for the Themes

## Classes Coming in Clutch

## Highlight of the Holiday

## This Year's Festive Log

## Difficulty Decrease

It became clear fairly early on that this year wouldn't be as challenging as
year's past; the first weekend didn't come with it's usual kick and at the time
I was rather disappointed. Advent of Code has represented a large part of my
festive schedule on other years. A humbling, frustrating experience that I've
scraped my way through. These 'quick' challenges sometimes represented my
entire day but in the end I always felt my time had been invested well as I
would emerge with new tricks, algorithms and mathematical understanding. This
year, the lack of challenge unfortunately came with a lack of growth.

I learnt a few things and, arguably as importantly, reinforced skills that had
lain dormant since last time but the post-battle euphoria happened only twice
and was nowhere near as powerful. That being said, I think this might have been
my favourite year in terms of difficulty. For the first time I was able to grab
two stars everyday. For the first time I didn't feel overwhelmed by a backlog
or tempted to look at someone else's answer for a clue. I felt like I was
coding with intention not just trying stuff hoping it I could wrangle the right
answer out of a mess of code.

I got less out of this year but put far less in terms of my time and energy
in to it - I think the trade was worthwhile.
