Another game means another day of translation rather than inspiration but
that is not to say that the solutions weren't enjoyable to implement. Come
and combat crabs with AoC day 22.

The rules one has to code around can be found on
[the official page](https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/22) and the results of my
fight with the cunning crustacean can be found below:

### Part One - Smooth Sailing

The code for this one really does speak for itself; not necessarily because of
how it's written but just because of how simple the rules are to implement:

{% highlight python %}

with open('inputs/2020_22.txt') as f:
    player_1, player_2 = [line for line in f.read().split('\n\n')]
    player_1 = [int(x) for x in player_1.split('\n')[1:]]
    player_2 = [int(x) for x in player_2.split('\n')[1:-1]]

while player_1 and player_2:
    one_card = player_1[0]
    two_card = player_2[0]
    if one_card > two_card:
        player_1.extend([one_card, two_card])
    else:
        player_2.extend([two_card, one_card])

    player_1 = player_1[1:]
    player_2 = player_2[1:]

winning_order = player_1 + player_2
winning_score = 0
for rev_index, card in enumerate(winning_order[::-1], 1):
    winning_score += rev_index * card

# Answer One
print("Winning player's score:", winning_score)

{% endhighlight %}

Looking at it now a pop() to set the one_card and two_card variables would have
probably been a better approach than the list splitting but the difference is
negligible as is the extension needed for...
